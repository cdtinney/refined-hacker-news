## Developing

### Workflows

To run the extension in development:

1. Clone the repository
2. [Install](#installing) and [run](#running)
3. Enable development extensions in [Chrome](#enabling-developer-extensions-in-chrome) or [Firefox](#enabling-developer-extensions-in-firefox) 

### Installing

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the fork locally and navigate to the containing folder
3. Install dependencies:
    ```
    $ npm install
    ```

### Running

To run the development server in watch mode:

```
$ npm run watch
```

### Enabling Developer Extensions in Chrome

In order to access the development build in Chrome, you must enable developer extensions.

1. Open Chrome
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` (`More Tools` > `Extensions`)
3. Enable `Developer mode` in the top-right corner
4. Click `Load unpacked`
5. Select the `dist` folder of the project directory

### Enabling Developer Extensions in Firefox

In order to access the development build in Firefox, you can either run it on the command-line via [`web-ext`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Getting_started_with_web-ext) or load it as a temporary add-on.

To run via command-line (with automatic reloading when files change):

1. Install `web-ext` globally:
    ```
    $ npm install -g web-ext
    ```
2. Make sure the development build is running (in watch mode)
3. Navigate into the `dist` directory, and run `web-ext`:
    ```
    $ web-ext run
    ```

This will open a browser with the add-on loaded.

To load as a temporary add-on:

1. Open Firefox
2. Navigate to `about:debugging`
3. Click `Enable add-on debugging`
4. Click `Load Temporary Add-on` and select the `manifest.json` file in the `dist` directory

### Linting

To run all linting:

```
$ npm run lint
```

To automatically fix linting errors:

```
$ npm run lint-fix
```
